Create associations between Contacts, Stores, and Vendors & Customers by
Dragging and Dropping each CRM type from a left column to a right column.

CRM types and associations are used through out the application to keep track of company, location, and contacts as needed. 

.. note::

  Make sure to set your company as Brand Owner:

  1. Double click or click on edit icon of your company name under Vendors & Customers and change **Type** field to Brand Owner. 

        * also from left navigation Settings -> Place of Business select your business name.


  2. At least one Customer & Supplier type in **Customer & Vendor** list.

        * This can also be set in the **Type** field under the add or edit form.
