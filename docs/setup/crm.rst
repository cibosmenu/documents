Create associations between Contacts, Stores, and Vendors & Customers by
Dragging and Dropping each CRM type from a left column to a right column.

CRM types and associations are used through out the application to keep track of company, location, and contacts as needed. 

.. note::

  Make sure to have the following setup under Vendors & Customers.

  * Your company as the Brand Owner. All orders will use this Information
     * In the web application go under Settings -> Place of Business to complete and save.


  * At least one Customer, Supplier, and Vendor in Customer & Vendor Locations list.
     * This can be set in the `Type` field under the add or edit form.
