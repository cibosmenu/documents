Orders
======

The Orders page in Cibos is separated into three essential groupings: Orders, Manufacturing Orders, and Fulfillment Status. Manufacturing Orders are separated from the other Order types because of a different workflow. Order types include Sales Order, Purchase Order, Credit Memo, Trade & Marketing Expense, and Lab Order. Manufacturing Orders are further separated into five stages to track Manufacturing Orders as they move through the stages of Open, Prepping, Processing, Storage, and Packaged. Fulfillment Status is used for tracking orders that are Shipped, Received, Invoiced/Billed, or Paid.
