Why CIBOS?
---------- 

  Unlike other iterations of software management tools for CPG, CIBOS is:

     * priced to help scale your brand
     * built for Food & Beverage
     * designed for "daily" ease of use


 CIBOS strives to simplify management and focus on business growth by adopting the `Kanban Board <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board>`_ philosophy where every UI & Workflow is **uniformly** designed. Each view has two to three columned lists with drag and drop elements, allowing the user to manage an entire workflow intuitively in every view just by moving items from left to right.

 Your company maybe using **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, or leaving it to an **Accountant** or **accounting software**. This approach takes up your time and money and puts you at a distance from your business and is prone to error and lack of insight.

 To grow your business you'll want daily insight. Check out :ref:`Analytics Overview` to get started.

 Dive deep into :ref:`Types of Workflows` and understand how to get the most out of managing your companies operations.
