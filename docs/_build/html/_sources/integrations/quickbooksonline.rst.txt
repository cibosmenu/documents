*How to Connect with QuickBooks*

					* CIBOS does not know about changes or orders created in QuickBooks Online, only orders initially made in CIBOS;
					* You may allow CIBOS to make payments if turned on in CIBOS **Settings > Accounting**;
					* CIBOS also requires some Quickbooks Online settings, so please look below at the following steps.
