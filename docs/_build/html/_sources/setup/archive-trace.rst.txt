Archive & Trace
===============
The Orders page in Cibos is separated into three essential groupings: **Orders**, **Manufacturing Orders**, and **Fulfillment Status**. Manufacturing Orders are separated from the other Order types because of a different workflow.

How to search the Archive

Once an **Order** has been **Archived**, it is removed from the Orders page and now accessible within the Archives. To navigate the Archive to find specific Orders

	1. Click the **Calendar icon** next to **Date**, select **Custom range**, and specify the **Custom range** using the pop-out Calendar. You can also select Last **7 Days** or **Last 30** Days. Then click **Apply**.

Traceability
------------

Cibos supports **Traceability**, so you can track a Lot or Batch of **Raw Materials** or Items through the entire supply chain before they reached your **Inventory**. Traceability can track which Lots or Batches of Raw Materials end up in which products/orders. Even when an item has been sold and removed from Inventory, it can still be tracked if needed. This is vital for efficient and effective handling of food recalls or other issues to best protect customers. Click the green arrow next to the green Search button to open the drop-down menu and select Trace to begin tracing.
