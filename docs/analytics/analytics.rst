Analytics Overview
================== 

The Analytics feature of Cibos is available for easy visualization of Sales, Cost of Goods, Freight Percentage, Landed Cost, Trade and Marketing Expenses, and Depletion data. Use the Analytics page to look for short- and long-term trends, identify what is and isn’t working well, and understand more about your business. Because the Analytics tool is fully integrated, you don’t need to export or alter any data, Cibos handles all of that for you.
